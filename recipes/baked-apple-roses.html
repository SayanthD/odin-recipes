    <p>These apple roses were inspired by a cook named Ana, a Brazilian food blogger living in Italy. I hope you give
        these gorgeous-looking and very delicious apple roses a try soon. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3 class="sub-header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large red apple, cored and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="sub-header short">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Adjust an oven rack to the middle position. Butter two (6
            to 8-ounce) ramekins and dust with white sugar.</li>
        <li>Place apple slices on a microwave-safe plate, overlapping slightly if necessary. Microwave on high until
            slices slightly soften, about 45 seconds. Cover the plate with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel.</li>
        <li>Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Roll puff pastry sheet to less than 1/8-inch thickness. Using a pizza cutter, cut two (3x12-inch)
            rectangles. Reserve remaining pieces for another use.</li>
        <li>Spread melted butter over dough; sprinkle with a generous amount of cinnamon sugar. Place apple slices along
            one long edge of dough, about 1/4 inch beyond the edge, overlapping slices slightly. Fold the bottom half of
            dough over apple slices to form a long "folder" of dough with rounded edges of apple slices exposed.</li>
        <li>Beat together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush surface of dough with egg wash. Sprinkle with cinnamon
            sugar.</li>
        <li>Starting at one end, roll dough to form a rose-shaped pastry. Seal roll with end of dough strip. Transfer
            roses to the prepared ramekins. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until well browned, about 45 minutes. Use tongs to remove the
            ramekins to a baking sheet to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove apple roses from the ramekins and finish
            cooling on a wire rack. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.</li>
    </ol>
